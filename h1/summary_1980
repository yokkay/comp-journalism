While there are a few words from this analysis that bear little information for us -- "we've," "I'm," and "I've," which might signal some linguistic tics of Jimmy Carter but not of his politica agenda -- there are several topics we can infer from the top 20 words sorted by descending tf-idf score.

One of the most "apparent" topics seems to be the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, given the top two words, "Soviet" and "Afghanistan." (The appearance of "Pakistan" in this list also indicates a growing interest in South/Central Asia, especially if we corroborate with evidence that the U.S. pledged military assistance to Pakistan in 1980.) The relatively high rank for the word "oil" (and "gasoline" and "middle," most likely co-occurring with "east") suggests a topical focus on alleviating dependence on oil from the Middle East, as well as oil-related motivations for the aforementioned Soviet invasion. The words "hostages," "Israel," and "Iran" also suggest the Iran hostage crisis factored in as a topic in this speech, given its recency in 1979. 

The date of the speech, in context with the words "nuclear," "superpowers," and those mentioned above (especially "Soviet") should signal that this speech documents Cold War rhetoric well.
